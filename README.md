## Overview

Tax calculator using React and Typescript.

This repo is created using the `create-react-app`. I know that this way of building the React application is now deprecated. At first, I decided to go with Next.Js. Since, this repo is concerned with React + Typescript, so I prefered `create-react-app` over Next.Js to work with pure React + Typescript and to avoid any abstraction provided by Next.Js framework.
